  <h3>Prologue</h3>

    <p class="text-paragraph two-column text-left-column">
    It was three months into lockdown. Our resident company entertainer was away on holiday, and my moment had finally come. Work asked if i wanted to run something for the office...
    <br>
    <br>
    I played it cool, but this was all I'd ever wanted.
    </p>

  <p class="text-paragraph two-column text-right-column">
    All these months working from home had been taking it's toll. Every waking moment on hangouts, desperately trying to pay attention, enough was enough.<br><br>

    Using Menti, a survey tool for business types trying to spice up their dull presentations. I made a quiz to remind everyone of the fun parts of work. Players vote and if you're in the majority you got a point. Everyone was so engaged with my dumb surveys they forgot to keep track of their points... I was the only winner that day.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>The Begining</h3>
  
      <p class="text-paragraph two-column text-left-column">
        More time in lockdown passed...
        <br> <br>
        The remnants of my old life had long since gone away, everything was empty. When suddenly the sound of slack rang through my bedroom office, like the bat signal over the streets of Gotham. Work needed a hero. They needed me. Could I, Jake Sharpe, make a mandatory all‚Äìday remote company meeting bearable?       <br><br>
        It was an impossible task, but this time I had budget for prizes and unlimited free time.
      <br>
      <br>

    <h3>Preying on 70‚Äôs nostalgia like I was there </h3>
    <p class="text-paragraph two-column text-left-column">
      Inspired by one of my all time heroes, tv presenter Noel Edmonds and Swap Shop. I created a short skit and shared it with some colleagues, and we started filming scenes with me dressed in a suit and bowtie around East London.<br> <br>
      I wanted to harness that 70s quiz show nostalgia and create a faux sense of community to remind everyone of the good old days. Unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt actually alive in the 70s, but if I was I‚Äôd be sitting in a pretty cushty director role by now. 
    <br>
    <br>  
    <br>  
    <br>  
    <br>  
  

    </p>
    <p class="text-paragraph two-column text-right-column">
      As the threads started to come together, something clicked, setting the tone for the entire quiz. The task was simple, create something so baffling that my colleagues, expecting a day of dry company presentations, would be so overwhelmed that they would have to pay attention. Like getting punched in the face at 09:30.
