  <span class="marquee marquee-top">Salon 63 is a collaboration between Artists and Salons along the number 63 bus route. It sets out to explore what a salon means to its community by bringing people together with art. I for some reason decided to build a site that randomly selects from CSS style sheets and ended up creating six times the ammount of work.

  <h3>Prologue</h3>

    <p class="text-paragraph two-column text-left-column">
    It was three months into lockdown. Our resident company entertainer was away on holiday, and my moment had finally come. Work asked if i wanted to run something for the office...
    <br>
    <br>
    I played it cool, but this was all I'd ever wanted.
    </p>

  <p class="text-paragraph two-column text-right-column">
    All these months working from home had been taking it's toll. Every waking moment on hangouts, desperately trying to pay attention, enough was enough.<br><br>

    Using Menti, a survey tool for business types trying to spice up their dull presentations. I made a ro remind everyone of the fun parts of work. Players voted on multiple choice answers and if you voted in the majority you got a point. Everyone was so engaged with my dumb surveys they forgot to keep track of their points... the only winner that day was me.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>The Begining</h3>
  
      <p class="text-paragraph two-column text-left-column">
        More time in lockdown passed...
        <br> <br>
        The remnants of my old life had long since gone away, everything was empty. When suddenly the sound of slack rang through my bedroom office, like the bat signal over the streets of Gotham. Work needed a hero. They needed me. Could I, Jake Sharpe, make a mandatory all day remote company meeting bearable?       <br><br>
        It was an impossible task, but this time I had budget for prizes and loads of free time.
