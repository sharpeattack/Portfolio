  <h3>The Setup </h3>

    <p class="text-paragraph two-column text-left-column">
      Smarty is a new mobile network built with simplicity at its core. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In a team of myself, a developer and a data person, we utilised customer feedback to find our areas of focus. and once located we‚Äôd strike with our arsenal. The kinds of techniques you‚Äôd commonly associate with ‚Äúgrowth hackers‚Äù. Running a/b tests, proposition development and honeypot tests with mailchimp and targeted ads.     
    </p>

  <p class="text-paragraph two-column text-right-column">
    Things of note;<br><br>
    ‚¨ä  Launched the cheapest plan ever <br>
    ‚¨ä  Total website hero revamp <br>
    ‚¨ä  Changed password requirement from 9 to 8 <br>
    ‚¨ä  Developed & validated a new loyalty proposition <br>
    <br>
    But these low hanging fruits had left us unsatisfied and it was time for a three course meal.

        Drop off in the payment journey was at a staggering 45% and we set out to find why. In the early days of Smarty, some bright spark had set up an abandon basket survey to collect responses. But no one had been brave enough to go through them... yet.
      <br>
      <br>
      After a long day wading through the swamp of 3000 responses, I had outlined 5 distinct categories. We took these to the client and began to explore how best to tackle these areas. It quickly became  clear that free sim cards, something commonplace amongst our competitors, could be our three course meal. Drasitcally reducing drop off and winning the customers we might otherwise lose.      
        <br>
        <br>
        But how could we, a humble team of three. Create a way to test a free sim card offering, without overhauling our entire distribution and checkout flow?

        Drop off in the payment journey was at a staggering 45%. We had several theories as to why, and some bright spark had set up an abandon basket survey to collect responses,

    <h3>Becoming the postman</h3>
  
      <p class="text-paragraph two-column text-left-column">
        Once the user details were in mailchimp, they would feed into the royal mail pre-postage service to make the labels. I would then add each to an envelope containing our trackable sim card and walk them to a nearby postbox.<br>
        <br>
        Over the next 3 days I sent over 700 sim cards all over the UK. On the second day we saw a small uptick in activation, but had doubled total sim orders that day. By removing less commuted users from the funnel we saw an 8% increase in conversion. On the fourth day we received some heart breaking news. Black Friday was around the corner and we had to kill the test. 
       <br>
       <br>
        We were never able to reach statistical significance and it still keeps me up at night.
