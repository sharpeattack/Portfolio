  <h3>Prologue</h3>

    <p class="text-paragraph two-column text-left-column">
    It was three months into lockdown. Our resident company entertainer was away on holiday and my moment had finally come. Work asked if i wanted to run something for the office...
    <br>
    <br>
    I played it cool, but this was all I'd ever wanted.
    </p>

  <p class="text-paragraph two-column text-right-column">
    All these months working from home had been taking it's toll. Every waking moment on hangouts desperately trying to pay attention, enough was enough.<br><br>

    Using Menti, a survey tool for business types trying to spice up their dull presentations. I made a quiz to remind everyone of the fun parts of work. Players vote and if you're in the majority you got a point. Everyone was so engaged with my dumb surveys they forgot to keep track of their points... I was the only winner that day.<br>
