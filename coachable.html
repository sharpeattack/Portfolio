            I decided to give this two week project a go because I really digged the "nobody want's a shitty boss" line. We've all been there. Built a nice lil visual system and website with these lovely folks.

  <h3> So why the hell does this exist Jake?</h3>

  <p class="text-paragraph two-column text-left-column">
    The year was 2017 and a start up I was working with had hit the big time on a forum in Korea. After much deliberation, it was time to throw fashion growth hacks, at completely unprepared Koreans. Over the next 7 weeks we launched different 3D digital look-books. Each showcasing a collection and giving users a new way to browse and try outfits online. 
    <br></br>
    To begin with engagement was incredible, but gradually users lost interest and we decided to give it one last hurrah, then pull the project entirely.
  </p>

  <p class="text-paragraph two-column text-right-column">
    Now it was time to dial everything up to 11, cutesy  mascots were finally on the agenda. They had performed well in user testing and were a huge part of Korean messaging apps already. So hastily, I began drawing mascots on a trackpad at speeds i thought near impossible. The world needed this and it was down to me to deliver it. 
    <br></br>
    Our final launch was magical, yet we still weren‚Äôt getting the engagement we needed. I think it‚Äôs important to highlight that this may have been a world first, it's just Korea wasn‚Äôt quite ready. But much like a phoneix rising from the ashes, the mascots got the second chance they deserved. When me and my mate Dem decided to make an iOS sticker pack.</p>
